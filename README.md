# Project Overview

In fall of 2020, Dr. Jessica Marie Johnson planted the seed for this project, bringing together a group of graduate student researchers to start looking into records from French and Spanish Colonial Louisiana that the Louisiana Historical Center has recently digitized. That digitization effort represented an incredible feat in making the documents available to researchers, but there remained references to Black people in Louisiana that the “search” functions overlooked, and important contextualizations that lay beyond the scope of that project. Our goal was to find these individuals and their stories, describe their significance using “keywords,” and make transcription of the hard-to-read handwriting and English translations of those transcriptions.

Our project aims to bring these stories to a broad audience of descendats, teachers, students, creatives, community members, and scholars. Over time, our team has grown to include scholars at various career levels - from undergraduates to full professors - and across numerous institutions. We also began a robust program of community engagement, working with public historians, cultural workers, educators, and descendants as advisors to the project.
