# K4BL Document Collection and Conversion Workflow, May 2024  

## Weekly Workflow (How We Do What We Do)

K4BL organizes documentary material around enslaved and free Black people humanity, stressing individuals as human actors with history, who are also changing history. The primary K4BL dataset of abstracts, keywords, and related document metadata is called the Bias Set, an Airtable spreadsheet of documents selected from the [Louisiana Colonial Documents Digitization Project](lacolonialdocs.org) at the New Orleans Jazz Museum and the Louisiana Historical Center. Our project methods are described below.

### The Bias Set (_Document Collection and Control, Keyword & Abstract Creation_)

The name “Bias Set” references the transformative work of Marisa Fuentes, who calls scholars to “read along the bias grain” and confront the violence of slavery's archive as we encounter enslaved and free people of African descent referenced within it (Fuentes, 2016). The Bias Set includes metadata from the LCDDP (dates, language, citations, provenance) in addition to metadata that speak to Black life. That metadata includes:

* keywords
* abstracts that tell the story of enslaved and free Black people in the document
* names of individuals of African descent
* names of individuals of Indigenous descent (where individuals are both, they are listed in both fields
* titles
* abstracts 
* and more....

The selection criteria for document collection is capacious:

**We will add any documents from the LHC site with references to Black and Black-Native people to the Bias Set on Airtable, including references to people via names, numbers, nouns, descriptions, pronouns, etc. It is also possible that over the course of tracing a story there might be additional documents that fit in without discrete references.** (Internal Documents, K4BL Workflow Guidance, 2023)  

**The Document Selectors**  

The Document Selectors review manuscript documents in the LCDDP for inclusion in the Bias Set. Decisions to include a document into the Bias Set are based on topic, presence of historical subjects of African descent mentioned by name, and presence of historical unnamed subjects of African descent (i.e. “esclaves marron,” “negro libre,” “trois negres”). Our selection standards are the result of intensive and continued conversation between the Research, Editorial, and Community Teams, centering Black agency and life experiences. The Research Team has discussed how to manage documents that do not have a clear reference to Black or Black-Indigenous people but offers other information relevant to Black life and history, such as geographic information about plantations or swamps used for marronage or resistance movements. We have determined for document selection purposes that references need to be clear and discrete to Black people living or dead, not conceptual. This conversation is on-going and in consultation with our KCCAB. 

Documents without clear or ambiguous references to Black people are added to the “Discard Set,” allowing researchers to track which LCDDP documents have been reviewed by others and which were not.

After identifying documents to add to the Bias Set, the Document Selectors are responsible for:  

* entering metadata on the documents into the Bias Set. This information includes drafting keywords, titles and abstracts that describe the experiences of Black life in the manuscript material.  
* downloading page image files from the LCDDP to Keywords storage on Dropbox (Digital Assistants for Editorial Markup may assist)

### From Bias Set to Transcriptions/Translations (_Selection, Arrangements, Transcription, Annotations, Encoding & Metadata Creation_) 

Having identified documents and included them in the Bias Set, the Document Selectors suggest 1-3 documents for their language team to begin transcribing and translating, generating a Google Doc file for each one and identifying those documents by their unique ID as queued for transcription/translation in the K4BL Workflow Inbox (Airtable). Slack is used to communicate within and between language teams. After discussion during power hours, the language teams choose which document(s) to begin to transcribe/translate for inclusion into the digital edition. The criteria for which documents move from queued to transcription/translation is based on a set of criteria developed over the planning period and continually being refined as our collective research continues. 

**Criteria for Inclusion in the Digital Edition:** 
* The document(s) make an urgent reference to Black and Black-Native life. The story is either untold or well-told and very deservedly so. Without a doubt, the document needs to be made widely accessible as soon as possible. (ex. living through the pandemic encouraged K4BL to focus on transcribing and translating documents referencing Black healing practices in Louisiana)
* The document(s) reference Black and Black-Native life and readers may be familiar with the story from other published scholarly research, but having the primary sources available and accessible will be important to Black public historians of Louisiana. The document needs to be made widely accessible as soon as possible. (ex. the first reference in the colonial documents to the Louisiana dish gumbo)
* The document(s) reference Black and Black-Native life and reader is not likely to be familiar with the people, events, or places described, but what is being described impacts arguments or observations scholars have made, is of interest to descended communities and Black public historians, and/or people broadly interested in history of slavery and the African diaspora (ex. cases of arson, poisioning, and other acts of resistance)
* The document(s) do not reference Black or Black-Native life, but does reference people, places, or events of relevance to an existing set of documents queued or in the process of being transcribed/translate.

**The Transcribers & The Translators**

Once the document for transcription/translation has been selected, the Transcribers review the Bias Set entry for errors and begin drafting the transcription. Transcribers can be any member of the language team with sufficient paleographic skill. 

When a draft of the transcription is ready, the Translators begin work on the translation. When the transcription and translation are complete, the language team bias set =, tje reviews the transcription and translation to confirm accuracy. The title and short abstract is drafted as a team, and the documents are sent to the Digital Team for conversion to markdown and additional metadata using VS Code. The additional metadata allows Wax Facets, the Jekyll template the site is built on, to organize stories by predetermined categories; for our purposes those categories are currently “by keyword,” “by date,” and “by name.” This organization responds to the ADE minimal guidelines for “access to the edition” to “supplement text searches” with other ways of searching beyond raw-text searching.[5] At the end of the week, the Research Team reviews progress on all transcriptions and translations, addressing questions arising and potential conversion errors. There is often overflow across weeks; the Research team may be working on as many as four or five transcriptions and translations and may add as many as four or five entries into the Bias Set per week.  

This workflow has emerged organically thanks to the planning grant and serves multiple purposes. First, it allows individuals with varied time commitments and levels of experience in the project to participate. Over the planning period, we discovered that there were many individuals reaching out about the project, particularly students seeking research experience and members of the descended community, who wished to assist in either transcribing or translating. Knowing exposure to the process is pedagogical and increases discoverability, we have created space within the process for individuals to participate in either transcribing or translating the documents without needing to be a dedicated member of the core team, which makes the programmatic and editorial decisions.[6] Second, we wanted to build in a minimum two-step verification of the abstracts, keywords, transcriptions and translations by all team members, instead of compartmentalizing the process. Creating and reviewing documents as a team allows Document Selector, Transcriber, and Translators to catch idiosyncrasies of language, syntax, and context (including notaries stylistic choices, repeated paleographic symbology, abbreviations, phraseology) at the level of the manuscript page and make consistent revisions/corrections all the way through to the translation phase. These details came to light because we have avoided separating research, editorial, and digital processes.[7] The Document Selector is a key part of the process. Although this person does not need to be a project editor, they do always need to be a senior member of the Research Team (i.e. have been with the project longer than two years and attended one summer workshop).

[6] We first began testing out a non-core Transcription & Translation (2T) team in Spring 2023 with the addition of Ashley Reynaga (Dillard) and Amrish Nair (JHU) to the Spanish Research Team. That has been a huge success and allowed the project to advance progress on the Spanish documentation, connect further to undergraduate research development at a Louisiana HBCU, and support student research and skills-building at the undergraduate and graduate level. As the process, particularly the two-step verification and review, continues to be refined, we envision being able to incorporate volunteer or crowd-sourced material into the process, either through individual volunteers, institutions like the Louisiana Creole Genealogical Society, or hosting “Transcribe-a-thons” to tackle larger batches of material. However, we did not want to engage in that kind of massive endeavor without a process for collecting and reviewing documents, as well as supporting researchers working with the documents.  
[7] This concern was first raised by Associate French Editor Olivia Barnard as a structural concern specific to Louisiana histories of this time period. By compartmentalizing by empire, the French, Spanish, and American periods have been cordoned off from each other, although Black lives have spanned and influenced each. In addition, past documentary projects, like the Works Progress Administration (WPA) abstracts now available in the Louisiana Historical Quarterly (LHQ), have also been created by individuals working in isolation from the full text of the material and not engaging across documents in multiple time periods which caused errors, misreadings, and bias in selection of documents for abstracting. As Barnard noted, “I have to transcribe to create a Bias Set entry, to even know which keywords to add.” While K4BL considered breaking the process down by task, we ultimately decided that a team workflow that involved multiple eyes on a single document would be the best way to ensure accuracy and accountability, as well as mutual learning, engagement, and intellectual growth among researchers themselves.
