# K4BL Black DH Statement

K4BL follows (and hopes to model) best practices in digital scholarship, particularly in the realm of the Black digital humanities. In “Making the Case for the Black Digital Humanities,” DH scholar Kim Gallon argues “any connection between humanity and the digital therefore requires an investigation into how computational processes might reinforce the notion of a humanity developed out of racializing systems, even as they foster efforts to assemble or otherwise build alternative human modalities. This tension is enacted through what I call a “technology of recovery,” characterized by efforts to bring forth the full humanity of marginalized peoples through the use of digital platforms and tools.”[1] We view the Black in Black Digital Humanities as invoking the North American mainland (African Americans), but also the African diaspora as well as the Caribbean archipelago, which is important for us as we research the history of a region at the crossroads of all three places.[2] In a special issue on the future of Black Digital Humanities, Kaiama Glover takes up the Black in Black DH as a Caribbean and hemispheric formulation. She calls on Caribbean digital humanists “to continue pushing toward that decentered frame in Black studies, to use technology as a means of substantively collaborating and sharing resources with colleagues situated outside of the U.S., and to advocate for multilingualism and translation.”[3] In short, the Black Digital Humanities engages recovery as it also challenges users, creators, and technicians to create, remix, and reimagine infrastructure and outcomes from the perspective of issues of labor, precarity, power, and connections to a global Black world. For K4BL, Black DH invites us to be deliberate and intentional about our ethics and community accountability even in infrastructure and design. In practice, this means K4BL has chosen to prioritize digital platforms that are sustainable to maintain, a design that is accessible to those with low bandwidth and on mobile devices, an aesthetic rooted in the Black community the site is designed to serve and represent, and a process that encourages collaboration, skills-building, and leadership development in team members, many of whom are students, including students in the region under study. The Sustaining Infrastructure and Technology (SIT) Team takes the lead in publishing the digital documentary edition, with much of the work labor led by the Project Manager/Digital Curation Fellow with the assistance of Digital Team members, the Technical Consultant, and the JHU Sheridan Library Engineer
