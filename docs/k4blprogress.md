K4BL is emerging from a two year NHPRC-Mellon planning grant this year. One of the goals of the planning period was to more accurately assess the pace of work and the capacity of the team as constituted to identify documents, create metadata, as well as initiate and complete transcriptions and translations. A the time of this application, three-quarters of the way through the two year planning grant period, K4BL had reviewed approximately 3,000 to 4,000 manuscript document pages, compiled 300 abstracts of stories centering Black historical subjects (comprising approximately 1,175 manuscript document pages of material), created 100 unique keywords to describe Black life in the colonial archive, and begun transcribing and translating 75 document pages of material in French and Spanish for inclusion in the digital documentary edition. The goals above are based on securing an implementation grant, with which we estimate being able to (at least) double the size of our existing research, editorial, and digital teams, compiling and uploading twice as much documentary material per year over the ten year funding period.
