# Progress Summary Data Visualization (May 2024)

K4BL is emerging from a two year NHPRC-Mellon planning grant this year. One of the goals of the planning period was to more accurately assess the pace of work and the capacity of the team as constituted to identify documents, create metadata, as well as initiate and complete transcriptions and translations. Now, in the implementation phase, we continue to build out the corpus of keywords, abstracts, transcriptions, and translations, as well as review document pages for evidence of enslaved and free people of African descent.
