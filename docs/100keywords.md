# List: 107 Keywords Generated by K4BL 

We define keywords as the simplest encapsulation of a topic that we have identified as salient to Black life in the colonial archive.  We use keywords to “designate collective thoughts, ideas, arguments, and experiences that might otherwise stand alone or be quickly subsumed” within the milieu of documentation in slavery’s archive. In digital form, keywords, like hashtags, also create “a searchable shortcut that can link people and ideas together.” (see Sarah J. Jackson et al., #HashtagActivism: Networks of Race and Gender Justice (Cambridge: The MIT Press, 2020))
