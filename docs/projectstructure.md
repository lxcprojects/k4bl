# K4BL Project Structure

Our project structure emerged over the course of the planning grant out of our determination to create a documentary edition shaped from the bottom up by community accountable organizing practices that prioritize intergenerational exchange, build leadership, nurture connection, and maintain relationships between and within Black communities (brown, 2017; Southerners on New Ground (SONG), 2016; Building Movements Project). Remixing, where useful, but largely resisting traditional and more hierarchical academic and publishing structures has allowed K4BL to shape research and editorial practices that responds to the needs and humanity of the community, but also the needs and humanity of team members. Although community accountable organizing practices span time and place, because we are also rooted in and committed to Gulf Coast Louisiana history and community, we also root ourselves in the intergenerational kinship work of Gulf Coast Black life, including practices of marronage, the ritual of culture bearing, blues epistemology, and black femme freedoms. (Vaz-Deville, 2013; Seck, 2014; Barnes and Breulin, 2014; Woods, 2017; Johnson, 2020; LifexCode, 2023; Saloy, 2023; Robinson 2023).
