# Project Structure

This project structure emerged over the course of the planning grant out of our determination to create a documentary edition shaped from the bottom up by community accountable organizing practices that prioritize intergenerational exchange, build leadership, nurture connection, and maintain relationships between and within Black communities. Remixing, where useful, but largely resisting traditional and more hierarchical academic and publishing structures has allowed K4BL to shape research and editorial practices that responds to the needs and humanity of the community, but also the needs and humanity of team members.

## Project Structure

Beyond the core team, individuals lead or participate in K4BL based on a team structure: Community, Digital, Editorial, Research, Sustaining Infrastructure & Technology (SIT), Transcription/Translation (2T), and Teaching Partners teams, as well as technical staff and consultants, and the Keywords Community Circle & Advisory Board which is comprised of Louisiana-based Black public historians, creators, culture-bearers, and descendants who gather with the team as a whole twice a year for the K4BL hosted spring meeting and summer Black History in Louisiana Workshop. For more see our Project Structure docs. The spring meeting is co-sponsored by the Black Louisiana History Incubators, a Diaspora Solidarities Lab micro-lab.
