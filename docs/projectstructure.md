# Project Structure

This project structure emerged over the course of the planning grant out of our determination to create a documentary edition shaped from the bottom up by community accountable organizing practices that prioritize intergenerational exchange, build leadership, nurture connection, and maintain relationships between and within Black communities. Remixing, where useful, but largely resisting traditional and more hierarchical academic and publishing structures has allowed K4BL to shape research and editorial practices that responds to the needs and humanity of the community, but also the needs and humanity of team members.
